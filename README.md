# Portfolio Website

**Purpose:** I want to build a website that has all the information a recruiter wants to see about me (even more than they want to see). At the same time, I want the website to be responsive, modern-looking, and lightweight.

## Here are some important links: 

- **Production URL of the application:** [https://abhilashkotha.akdeployments.cloud/](https://abhilashkotha.akdeployments.cloud/)
- **Project Proposal:** [proposal.md](DesignFiles/prposal.md)
- **Figma Prototype:** [figmadesign.md](DesignFiles/figmadesign.md)

## How to use the app
- Visit the [URL](https://abhilashkotha.akdeployments.cloud/)
- Scroll to the section you want to read
- If you want to download the resume, click on "Resume" button
- If you want to visit my social networking profiles, click on the respective icons
- If you want to send me a message, scroll to the bottom of the page, fill in the information and click send. 
- If you are feeling bored, keep clicking the dislike button on the landing page to get a new joke every time

## What technologies and tools did I use?

- Next JS
- Tailwind CSS
- Custom CSS
- Vercel for deployment
- GitHub for version management and automatic deployment
- Visual Studio Code for development and coding
- Figma for visual designs
